## ASSIGNMENT 2

1.Add a command line argument which is the name of a configuration file. This file should contain the contents of the options object. Note that app.js should start up correctly without this option file being specified; in this case it should behave as app.js does (with respect to the options, not the lucky return code).

2.output config file with request properties 

3.Add a new 777 status code if there is a request for any document with the word "lucky" in its URL (path or document name).
