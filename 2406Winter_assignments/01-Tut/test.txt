First, with the sync version, try the following:

Make the search pattern into a regular expression.
Give it an additional argument that causes matched lines to be output to a new file. You'll need to use writeFileSync() from the Node fs module. When finished, output "All done!" to the console.
Make the output lines sorted in alphabetical order.
Then, do all of the above with the async version. Make sure to use writeFile(), not writeFileSync()!

You may find the following methods useful when working with arrays:push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), and join().
