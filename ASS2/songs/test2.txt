Sister Golden Hair -America 
Well I tried to make it sunday but I [G#min] got so damned depressed 
That I set my sights on [E] monday and I got myself undressed 
I ain't ready for the alter, I do [G#min] believe there's [A] times 
When a [F#min] can [A] be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E] 
sure  [E] [G#min] 
verse1: [C#min] 
but [A] woman
